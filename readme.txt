A shortcode for displaying paginated lists of users.

== Description ==

Other plugins output paginated lists of users, but I needed to be able to customize and style this list to fit my theme.  So I created this plugin to use templates that can be overridden and customized by theme developers.

= Usage =

Place this shortcode anywhere you'd like to display a full list of all your blog's users.

`
[userlist]
`

By default the plugin will split the users up based on the "Posts per Page" setting under Settings->Reading.

See the [FAQ](http://wordpress.org/plugins/simple-user-listing/faq/) for more details on how to modify the list results.

= Support =

Support is handled in the [WordPress forums](http://wordpress.org/support/plugin/simple-user-listing). Please note that support is limited and does not cover any custom implementation of the plugin. 

Please report any bugs, errors, warnings, code problems to [Github](https://github.com/helgatheviking/simple-user-listing/issues)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `plugin` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. Add the shortcode [userlist] anywhere you wish to display a list of users

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I can't get the search users to work? =

The search form will not work with the default permalinks. Try changing your permalinks to some other structure.  The reason is form submits via the GET method and so adding those parameters to the URL seem to clash with the parameters already on the URL from the default permalink setup.

= The search doesn't respect the shortcode parameters =

Likely you are experiencing a conflict with another plugin, specifically one that is filtering `pre_user_query` to modify all user queries. The S2 Member plugin is a known culprit of this. To disable S2 Member's modifications on all Simple User Listing lists, add the following to your theme's functions.php or to a site-specific plugin. Ensure you are using at least SUL 1.5.3.

`
function kia_protect_sul_from_s2(){
	remove_action('pre_user_query', 'c_ws_plugin__s2member_users_list::users_list_query');
}
add_action( 'simple_user_listing_before_loop', 'kia_protect_sul_from_s2' );

function kia_restore_s2(){
	add_action('pre_user_query', 'c_ws_plugin__s2member_users_list::users_list_query');
}
add_action( 'simple_user_listing_after_loop', 'kia_restore_s2' );
`

= How Can I Customize the User Query? =

Simple User Listing supports most of the parameters of the `WP_User_Query` class as parameters for the shortcode.  For example you can pass it a role defining which type of users you'd like to list.  You can also adjust the number of users displayed per page. Roles must be in lowercase. 

`
[userlist role="author" number="5"]
`

As of version 1.2 you can now sort the user list by and of the sort parameters supported by `WP_User_Query()`.  For example, the following would list your users based on number of posts written, with the highest first.

`
[userlist orderby="post_count" order="DESC"]
`

As of version 1.4 you can now list users by a meta key. Be careful with this as this is not exactly an efficient query.

`
[userlist meta_key="foo" meta_value="widgets"]
`

As of version 1.4.2 you can now include and exclude users with a comma separated list of IDs.

`
[userlist exclude="1,2,3"]
`

The full list of supported parameters (shown with default value) is:

`
'query_id' => 'simple_user_listing',
'role' => '',
'include' => '',
'exclude' => '',
'blog_id' => '',
'number' => get_option( 'posts_per_page', 10 ),
'order' => 'ASC',
'orderby' => 'login',
'meta_key' => '',
'meta_value' => '',
'meta_compare' => '=',
'meta_type' => 'CHAR',
'count_total' => true,
`

To know which values are supported, please see the [WP Codex reference on WP_User_Query](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_User_Query#Parameters).

= How Can I Sort the Users by Last Name? =

As of verison 1.5.2 you could simply use the following as your shortcode:

`
[userlist meta_key="last_name" orderby="meta_value" order="ASC"]
`

= How Can I Customize the HTML/text, etc? =

The whole reason I wrote this was that other similar plugins had too much control over the output.  You can style the output anyway you'd like by adding your own template parts to your theme.

Copy the files you wish to modify from the `simple-user-listing/templates` folder of the plugin and paste them into a `simple-user-listing` folder in the root of your theme (so `my-theme/simple-user-listing`).  Now you can change the markup any way you please.  It will be similar to template parts for post loops, except you will have access to each user's `$user` object instead of the $post object.

For more details on what is available in the `$user` object [see the Codex reference on WP_User()](http://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_User)

= Does Simple User Listing work with WP_Pagenavi? =

Yes! [WP Pagenavi](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-pagenavi/) supports pagination for `WP_User_Query` and I configured the navigation-author.php template to automatically use WP Pagenavi if it is installed and activated.

= How can I setup custom search? (search by a meta field) =

First you need to change your search form.  You can do that by creating a new `search-authors.php` template in the `simple-user-listing` folder of your theme.

For example, if I wanted to search by the meta field "billing_city" I would have my search template look like the following:

`
<?php
/**
 * The Template for displaying Author Search
 *
 * Place this file in your theme
 * yourtheme/simple-user-listing/search-author.php
 *
 */

if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) exit; // Exit if accessed directly

$search = ( get_query_var( 'billing_city' ) ) ? get_query_var( 'billing_city' )  : '';

global $sul_users;
?>

<div class="author-search">
  <h2><?php _e('Search authors by city' ,'simple-user-listing');?></h2>
		<form method="get" id="sul-searchform" action="<?php the_permalink() ?>">
			<label for="as" class="assistive-text"><?php _e('Search' ,'simple-user-listing');?></label>

<input type="text" class="field" name="billing_city" id="sul-s" placeholder="<?php _e('Search Authors' ,'simple-user-listing');?>" value="<?php echo $search; ?>"/>

			<input type="submit" class="submit" id="sul-searchsubmit" value="<?php _e('Search Authors' ,'simple-user-listing');?>" />
		</form>
	<?php
	if( $search ){ ?>
		<h2 ><?php printf( __('Search Results for: %s' ,'simple-user-listing'), '<em>' . $search .'</em>' );?></h2>
		<a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>"><?php _e('Back To Author Listing' ,'simple-user-listing');?></a>
	<?php } ?>
</div><!-- .author-search -->
`

Next you'll need to modify the shortcode's arguments for `WP_User_Query`.  You can do that by filtering `sul_user_query_args` and then adding your parameters to the Simple User Listing's whitelist by filtering `sul_user_query_args`.

Add the following to your theme's functions.php:

`
/**
 * Place this in your theme's functions.php file
 * Or a site-specific plugin
 *
 */
// Switch the WP_User_Query args to a meta search
function kia_meta_search( $args ){

  // this $_GET is the name field of the custom input in search-author.php
	$search = ( isset($_GET['billing_city']) ) ? sanitize_text_field($_GET['billing_city']) : false ;

	if ( $search ){
		// if your shortcode has a 'role' parameter defined it will be maintained
		// unless you choose to unset the role parameter by uncommenting the following
		//	unset( $args['role'] );
		$args['meta_key'] = 'billing_city';
		$args['meta_value'] = $search;
		$args['meta_compare'] = '=';
	}

	return $args;
}
add_filter('sul_user_query_args', 'kia_meta_search');

// Register query var and whitelist with Simple User Listing
function kia_search_vars( $vars ){
	$vars[] = 'billing_city';
	return $vars;
}
add_filter('sul_user_allowed_search_vars', 'kia_search_vars');
`

Now the search will return users that match the entered "billing_city".  You can adjust as needed for more complicated meta queries.
